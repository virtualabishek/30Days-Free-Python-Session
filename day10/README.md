# Day 10 Homework

## Problem 1: Count to Ten
Write a program that prints numbers from 1 to 10.

- Use a variable `i` starting at 1.
- Use a while loop to print the value of `i`.
- Increment `i` by 1 in each iteration.

## Problem 2: Print "Hello World" Five Times
Write a program that prints "Hello World" five times.

- Use a variable `count` starting at 0.
- Use a while loop to print "Hello World".
- Increment `count` by 1 in each iteration.

## Problem 3: Print Even Numbers
Write a program that prints even numbers from 2 to 10.

- Use a variable `number` starting at 2.
- Use a while loop to print the value of `number`.
- Increment `number` by 2 in each iteration.


## Problem 4: Counting Down
Write a program to count down from 10 to 1.

- Use a variable `i` starting at 10.
- Use a while loop to print the value of `i`.
- Decrement `i` by 1 in each iteration.

## Problem 5: Print "Good Morning" Seven Times
Write a program to print "Good Morning" seven times.

- Use a variable `count` starting at 0.
- Use a while loop to print "Good Morning".
- Increment `count` by 1 in each iteration.


## Problem 6: Print Numbers Until a Certain Value
Write a program that prints numbers starting from 1 until a number entered by the user.

- Get an integer input from the user and store it in variable `n`.
- Use a variable `i` starting at 1.
- Use a while loop to print the value of `i`.
- Increment `i` by 1 in each iteration.
- Stop the loop when `i` is greater than `n`.

## Problem 7: Counting By Twos
Write a program that prints numbers from 0 to 20 in increments of 2.

- Use a variable `i` starting at 0.
- Use a while loop to print the value of `i`.
- Increment `i` by 2 in each iteration.
