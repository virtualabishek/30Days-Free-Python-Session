# Homework of Day 5

1. **Dividing Copies Among Students**
    ```python
    # Get the number of copies and students from the user, and find out how many copies each student gets and the number of remaining copies.
    # - Create a variable named copy_number and assign it the input value.
    # - Create another variable named student_number and assign it the input value.
    # - Compute and print the number of copies each student will get.
    # - Compute and print the number of remaining copies that cannot be divided equally.
    ```

2. **Discount Calculation**
    ```python
    # Get the price of an item and the discount percentage from the user, and calculate the final price after the discount.
    # - Create a variable named price and assign it the input value.
    # - Create another variable discount_percent and assign it the input value.
    # - Compute the discount using the formula (discount_percent / 100) * price and assign it to the discount variable...
    # - Compute and print the final price after subtracting the discount from the price.
    ```

3. **Simple Addition**
    ```python
    # Get two numeric inputs from the user, add them, and print the sum.
    # - Create variables num1 and num2 and assign them the input values.
    # - Add num1 and num2, and store the result in a variable named sum.
    # - Print the sum.
    ```

4. **Multiplication of Two Floating Numbers**
    ```python
    # Get two floating-point numbers from the user, multiply them, and print the product.
    # - Create variables num1 and num2 and assign them the input values.
    # - Multiply num1 and num2, and store the result in a variable named product.
    # - Print the product.
    ```

5. **Finding the Quotient and Remainder**
    ```python
    # Get the number of apples and students from the user, and find out how many apples each student gets and the number of remaining apples.
    # - Create a variable named apple_count and assign it the input value.
    # - Create another variable named student_count and assign it the input value.
    # - Compute and print the number of apples each student will get.
    # - Compute and print the number of remaining apples that cannot be divided equally.
    ```

6. **Square of the Sum**
    ```python
    # Get two numeric type inputs from the user, convert them to float, add them, and print the square of the sum.
    # - Create variables number1 and number2 and assign them the input values.
    # - Add number1 and number2, and store the result in a variable named result.
    # - Print the square of the result.
    ```

7. **Using Parentheses in Arithmetic Operations**
    ```python
    # Get two numeric inputs from the user, perform an arithmetic operation with parentheses, and print the result.
    # - Create variables num1 and num2 and assign them the input values.
    # - Perform the operation: 56 * 4 + (num1 + num2) / 3
    # - Print the result.
    ```
