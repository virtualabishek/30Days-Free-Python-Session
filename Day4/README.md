# Homework of Day 3

1. **Discount Calculation**
    ```python
    # Suppose you are a university student and you need to pay 1536 dollars as your tuition fee.
    # The college is offering a 10% discount on early payments. To solve this problem:
    # - Create a variable named fee and assign 1536 to it.
    # - Create another variable discount_percent and assign 10 to it.
    # - Compute the discount by using the formula (discount_percent / 100) * fee and assign it to the discount variable.
    # - Compute and print the fee you have to pay by subtracting discount from fee.
    ```

2. **Dividing Pens Among Students**
    ```python
    # Suppose you have to divide 14 pens among 3 students equally.
    # You need to find out how many pens each student would get (if pens must be divided equally), and the number of remaining pens that cannot be divided.
    # - Create a variable named pen_number and assign 14 to it.
    # - Create another variable named student_number and assign 3 to it.
    # - Compute the number of pens each student will get and print it.
    # - Compute the number of remaining pens and print it.
    ```

3. **Profit Calculation**
    ```python
    # Suppose the cost price of a book is 25 dollars. Store it in a variable named cost_price.
    # The selling price of the book is 35 dollars. Store it in a variable named selling_price.
    # Calculate the profit amount on the book.
    ```

4. **Using Parentheses in Arithmetic Operations**
    ```python
    # Simplify the following arithmetic operations using parentheses:
    # - 45 * 34 / 34 + 34 + 5
    # - [940 + (45 + 34) / 3]
    ```

5. **Simple Arithmetic Operations**
    ```python
    # 100 divided by 20 and multiply the answer by 3
    ```

6. **Nepal Landmarks**
    ```python
    # Create a variable named landmark and assign it the value "Pashupatinath".
    # Create another variable named city and assign it the value "Kathmandu".
    # Print a statement that includes both variables.
    ```

7. **Daily Temperature**
    ```python
    # Create a variable named today's temperature and assign it a value of 30.
    # Print the variable.
    # Change the value of the variable to 25 and print it again.
    ```
