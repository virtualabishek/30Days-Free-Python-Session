# Homework of Day 3

1. **Discount Calculation**
    ```python
    # Suppose you are a university student and you need to pay 150000 rs as your tuition fee.
    # The college is offering a 30% discount on early payments. To solve this problem:
    # - Create a variable named fee and assign 1536 to it.
    # - Create another variable discount_percent and assign 10 to it.
    # - Compute the discount by using the formula (discount_percent / 100) * fee and assign it to the discount variable.
    # - Compute and print the fee you have to pay by subtracting discount from fee.
    ```

2. **Dividing Pens Among Students**
    ```python
    # Suppose you have to divide 1453 pens among 40 students equally.
    # You need to find out how many pens each student would get (if pens must be divided equally), and the number of remaining pens that cannot be divided.
    # - Create a variable named pen_number and assign 1453 to it.
    # - Create another variable named student_number and assign 40 to it.
    # - Compute the number of pens each student will get and print it.
    # - Compute the number of remaining pens and print it.
    ```

3. **Profit Calculation**
    ```python
    # Suppose the cost price of a book is 2542 dollars. Store it in a variable named cost_price.
    # The selling price of the book is 3532 dollars. Store it in a variable named selling_price.
    # Calculate the profit amount on the book.
    ```

4. **Using Parentheses in Arithmetic Operations**
    ```python
    # Simplify the following arithmetic operations using parentheses:
    # - 45 * 34 / 34 + 34 + 5
    # - [940 + (45 + 34) / 3]
    ```

5. **Simple Arithmetic Operations**
    ```python
    # 100 divided by 20 and multiply the answer by 3
    ```
6. **Dividing Copies Among Students**
    ```python
    # Suppose you have to divide 50 copies among 7 students equally.
    # - Create a variable named copy_number and assign 50 to it.
    # - Create another variable named student_number and assign 7 to it.
    # - Compute the number of copies each student will get and print it.
    # - Compute the number of remaining copies that cannot be divided equally and print it.
    ```
