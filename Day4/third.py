''' Suppose you have to divide 14 pens among 3 students equally.
    You need to find out how many pens each student would get (if pens must be divided equally), and the number of remaining pens that cannot be divided.
    To solve this problem, create a variable named pen_number and assign 14 to it.
    Create another variable named student_number and assign 3 to it.
    Compute the number of pens each student will get and print it.
    Compute the number of remaining pens and print it.

#do yourself
num = 4
pow = num**3

print(pow)
