# Homework of Day 12

# Python While Loop Homework

## Problem 1: Sum of Positive Numbers
Write a program to find the sum of positive numbers entered by the user. Stop when the user enters a negative number or 0.

- Get a float input from the user.
- Initialize a variable `total` to 0.
- Use a while loop to add the entered number to `total` as long as it's positive.
- Print the value of `total` after the loop ends.

## Problem 2: Countdown Timer
Write a program that takes an integer input from the user and counts down to 0.

- Get an integer input from the user and store it in variable `countdown`.
- Use a while loop to print the value of `countdown`.
- Decrease the value of `countdown` by 1 in each iteration.
- Stop the loop when `countdown` reaches 0.

## Problem 3: Print Even Numbers
Write a program to print all even numbers from 1 to 20.

- Use a variable `num` starting at 2.
- Use a while loop to print the value of `num` as long as it is less than or equal to 20.
- Increment `num` by 2 in each iteration.

## Problem 4: Multiplication Table
Write a program to print the multiplication table of 3.

- Use a variable `i` starting at 1.
- Use a while loop to print `3 * i` for `i` from 1 to 10.
- Increment `i` by 1 in each iteration.

## Problem 5: User Input Loop
Write a program that asks the user to enter numbers. The program should continue asking for numbers until the user enters 0.

- Use a while loop to prompt the user for input.
- Print the entered number.
- Exit the loop when the user enters 0.

## Problem 6: Sum of Even Numbers
Write a program to calculate the sum of the first 10 even numbers.

- Initialize a variable `total` to 0 and `num` to 2.
- Use a while loop to add the value of `num` to `total` as long as `num` is less than or equal to 20.
- Print the value of `total` after the loop ends.

## Problem 7: Counting Backwards
Write a program to print numbers from 10 to 1.

- Use a variable `num` starting at 10.
- Use a while loop to print the value of `num`.
- Decrease the value of `num` by 1 in each iteration.

## Problem 8: Factorial Calculation
Write a program to calculate the factorial of a given positive integer.

- Get an integer input from the user and store it in variable `n`.
- Initialize a variable `factorial` to 1.
- Use a while loop to multiply `factorial` by `n`.
- Decrease the value of `n` by 1 in each iteration.
- Print the value of `factorial` after the loop ends.

## Problem 9: Print Odd Numbers
Write a program to print all odd numbers from 1 to 15.

- Use a variable `num` starting at 1.
- Use a while loop to print the value of `num` as long as it is less than or equal to 15.
- Increment `num` by 2 in each iteration.

## Problem 10: Average of Numbers
Write a program to calculate the average of numbers entered by the user. The program should stop when the user enters a negative number.

- Use a while loop to ask the user for a number.
- Keep a running total of the numbers entered and a count of the numbers.
- Calculate the average once the loop ends and print it.
