# Day 13 Homework

## Problem 1: Print Each Character
Write a program to print each character of a string on a new line.

- Get a string input from the user and store it in the variable `word`.
- Use a for loop to iterate over each character in `word`.
- Print each character.

## Problem 2: Print Numbers 1 to n
Write a program to print numbers from 1 to a given number n.

- Get an integer input from the user and store it in the variable `n`.
- Use a for loop to print numbers from 1 to n (inclusive).

## Problem 3: Print Even Numbers
Write a program to print all even numbers from 1 to a given number n.

- Get an integer input from the user and store it in the variable `n`.
- Use a for loop to iterate from 1 to n.
- Print the number if it is even.

## Problem 4: Print "Hello" Multiple Times
Write a program to print "Hello" a certain number of times.

- Get an integer input from the user for the number of times to print "Hello".
- Use a for loop to print "Hello" that many times.

## Problem 5: Print Sum of First n Numbers
Write a program to find the sum of the first n natural numbers.

- Get an integer input from the user and store it in the variable `n`.
- Initialize a variable `total` to 0.
- Use a for loop to iterate from 1 to n.
- Add each number to `total`.
- Print the value of `total`.

## Problem 6: Print Numbers in a Range
Write a program to print numbers between two numbers (inclusive).

- Get two integer inputs from the user: `start` and `end`.
- Use a for loop to print all numbers from `start` to `end` (inclusive).
