## Python Day - 17 Homework

### 1. Calculate the Sum of Even Numbers

**Problem Description:**  
Write a program to calculate the sum of all even numbers from 1 to a given number `n`.

**Instructions:**
- Define a function named `sum_even_numbers(n)` that takes an integer `n` as an argument.
- Inside the function, use a loop to add up all even numbers from 1 to `n`.
- Print the sum inside the function.

### 2. Calculate the Product of Odd Numbers

**Problem Description:**  
Write a program to find the product of all odd numbers between 1 and a given number `n`.

**Instructions:**
- Define a function named `product_odd_numbers(n)` that takes an integer `n` as an argument.
- Inside the function, use a loop to multiply all odd numbers from 1 to `n`.
- Print the product inside the function.

### 3. Find the Smallest of Three Numbers

**Problem Description:**  
Write a program to find the smallest of three numbers.

**Instructions:**
- Define a function named `smallest_of_three(a, b, c)` that takes three numbers as arguments.
- Inside the function, use if-elif-else to find the smallest number among the three.
- Print the smallest number inside the function.

### 4. Check if a Number is Prime

**Problem Description:**  
Write a program to check if a number is prime.

**Instructions:**
- Define a function named `is_prime(n)` that takes an integer `n` as an argument.
- Inside the function, check if `n` is divisible only by 1 and itself.
- Print whether the number is prime or not inside the function.

### 5. Calculate the Factorial of a Number Using Recursion

**Problem Description:**  
Write a program to calculate the factorial of a number using recursion.

**Instructions:**
- Define a function named `factorial(n)` that takes an integer `n` as an argument.
- Inside the function, use recursion to calculate the factorial of `n`.
- Print the factorial inside the function.

### 6. Check if a Number is Positive, Negative, or Zero

**Problem Description:**  
Write a program to check if a number is positive, negative, or zero.

**Instructions:**
- Define a function named `check_number(n)` that takes an integer `n` as an argument.
- Inside the function, use if-elif-else to check if `n` is positive, negative, or zero.
- Print the result inside the function.
