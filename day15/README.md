# Day - 15 - Python Homework

## Problem 1: Infinite Input Loop
**Problem Description:**  
Write a program to continuously ask for integer input from the user using an infinite while loop.

- If the number is between 1 and 100 (inclusive), print the number.
- If the number is outside of this range, terminate the loop.

## Problem 2: First Even Number Greater Than 10
**Problem Description:**  
Write a program to find the first even number greater than 10 in a given list.

- Use a for loop to iterate through the given list of numbers.
- If the number is 10 or below, use the `continue` statement to skip that number.
- If the number is greater than 10 and even, print that number and exit the loop with `break`.

## Problem 3: Even Numbers Less Than a Given Number
**Problem Description:**  
Write a program that asks the user for a number and then prints all even numbers less than that number.

- Get integer input from the user.
- Use a for loop to iterate from 1 to the given number.
- Use an if statement to check if the number is even. If it is, print the number.
- Skip the odd numbers using `continue`.

## Problem 4: Even Numbers Less Than 7 in a List
**Problem Description:**  
Write a program to print even numbers less than 7 from a given list.

- Use a for loop to iterate through the numbers in the list.
- If the number is odd, use `continue` to skip that number.
- Use an if-else block inside a while loop to check if the even number exceeds the given threshold of 7. If it doesn't, print the number.

## Problem 5: Print All Characters Except Vowels
**Problem Description:**  
Write a program that takes a string as input and prints all the characters except vowels.

- Use a for loop to iterate through each character in the string.
- Use an if statement to check if the character is a vowel. If it is, use `continue` to skip it.
- Print all other characters.

## Problem 6: Sum of Numbers Until Zero
**Problem Description:**  
Write a program that continuously takes integer input from the user and calculates the sum of all numbers entered until the user enters 0.

- Use a while loop to take inputs and add them to a sum variable.
- If the user enters 0, break the loop and print the sum.

## Problem 7: Multiplication Table
**Problem Description:**  
Write a program to print the multiplication table of a given number.

- Get an integer input from the user.
- Use a for loop to iterate through numbers 1 to 10.
- Print the product of the given number and the current iteration number.

## Problem 8: Finding the Largest Number in a List
**Problem Description:**  
Write a program to find the largest number in a given list.

- Use a for loop to iterate through the list.
- Initialize a variable with a very small number (or the first element in the list) and compare each number in the list to update the largest number found.
- Print the largest number after the loop ends.
