# Python Homework: Break and Continue

## Problem 1: Stop at Five
Write a program to print numbers from 1 to 10, but stop if the number is 5.

- Use a for loop to print numbers from 1 to 10.
- If the current number is 5, use the `break` statement to exit the loop.

## Problem 2: Skip Number 3
Write a program to print numbers from 1 to 5, but skip the number 3.

- Use a for loop to print numbers from 1 to 5.
- If the current number is 3, use the `continue` statement to skip the rest of the loop body.

## Problem 3: Stop at Negative Number
Write a program that keeps asking the user for a number and prints it. Stop the loop if the user enters a negative number.

- Use a while loop to continuously get input from the user.
- Print the number.
- Use the `break` statement to exit the loop if the user enters a negative number.

## Problem 4: Skip Odd Numbers
Write a program to print even numbers from 1 to 10, skipping the odd numbers.

- Use a for loop to iterate from 1 to 10.
- Use an `if` statement with the `continue` keyword to skip the current iteration if the number is odd.

## Problem 5: First Five Numbers
Write a program to print the first five numbers greater than 0.

- Use a while loop that starts with a number variable set to 1.
- Print the number and increment it by 1 each time.
- Use the `break` statement when the number reaches 6.

## Problem 6: Skip Multiples of 3
Write a program to print numbers from 1 to 10 but skip the multiples of 3.

- Use a for loop to iterate from 1 to 10.
- Use the `continue` statement to skip the current iteration if the number is a multiple of 3.
