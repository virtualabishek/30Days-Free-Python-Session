# Problem 10: Average of Numbers
# Write a program to calculate the average of numbers entered by the user. The program should stop when the user enters a negative number.

# Use a while loop to ask the user for a number.
# Keep a running total of the numbers entered and a count of the numbers.
# Calculate the average once the loop ends and print it.
