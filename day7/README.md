# Homework of Day 7

1. **Swapping Values**
    ```python
    # Problem Description:
    # Write a program to swap the values of two variables.
    # Target: x = "Apple" and y = "Banana"
    # - Assign "Apple" to variable x and "Banana" to variable y.
    # - Swap the values of x and y using a temporary variable.
    # - Print the values of x and y before and after swapping.
    ```

2. **Printing Variable Values**
    ```python
    # Problem Description:
    # Write a program to print the values of two variables.
    # - Assign the value 15 to variable num1 and 30 to variable num2.
    # - Print the values of num1 and num2 in a single print statement using f-strings.
    ```

3. **Type Function**
    ```python
    # Problem Description:
    # Write a program to display the types of different variables.
    # - Assign the value "Hello" to variable greeting and True to variable status.
    # - Use the type() function to print the types of greeting and status.
    ```

4. **Variable Comparisons**
    ```python
    # Problem Description:
    # Write a program to perform comparisons between two variables.
    # - Get two integer inputs from the user and store them in var1 and var2, respectively.
    # - Compare var1 and var2 using the comparison operators <, >, and != respectively.
    # - Print the results in the format shown in the Expected Output section.
    # 
    # Expected Output:
    # var1 < var2: True/False
    # var1 > var2: True/False
    # var1 != var2: True/False
    ```

5. **String Comparison**
    ```python
    # Problem Description:
    # Write a program to compare two strings.
    # - Get two string inputs and store them in variables str1 and str2, respectively.
    # - Check if the two strings are equal and print the result.
    ```

6. **Divisibility Check**
    ```python
    # Problem Description:
    # Write a program to print True if a number is divisible by 7. If not, print False.
    # - Get an integer input from the user.
    # - Check if the input is divisible by 7 or not.
    # - If it's divisible by 7, print True.
    # - If not, print False.
    ```
