# Homework of Day 3

1. **Temperature Conversion**
    ```python
    # Problem Description:
    # Write a program to convert temperature from Celsius to Fahrenheit.
    # Formula: fahrenheit = (celsius * 1.8) + 32
    # - Get temperature in Celsius from the user and assign it to a variable.
    # - Convert it to degree Fahrenheit using the above formula.
    # - Print the result.
    ```

2. **Swapping Values**
    ```python
    # Problem Description:
    # Write a program to swap two values.
    # - Get two numeric inputs from the user and assign them to variables x and y.
    # - Swap the values of x and y.
    # - Print the values of x and y after swapping.
    ```

3. **Quadratic Equation and Formula Problem**
    ```python
    # Problem Description:
    # Write a program to solve a quadratic equation using the formula.
    # Formula: x = (-b + sqrt(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a
    # - Get inputs a, b, and c from the user.
    # - Compute the value of x using the above formula.
    # - Print the result.
    ```

4. **Area of a Triangle**
    ```python
    # Problem Description:
    # Suppose a, b, and c are three sides of a triangle. Then, the area of a triangle is given as:
    # s = (a+b+c)/2
    # area = (s*(s-a)*(s-b)*(s-c))**0.5
    # Write a program to calculate the area of a triangle.
    # - Get three numeric inputs from the user and store them in variables a, b, and c.
    # - Compute the semiperimeter s and then the area of the triangle using the above formula.
    # - Print the area.
    ```

5. **Body Mass Index (BMI) Calculation**
    ```python
    # Problem Description:
    # Write a program to calculate the Body Mass Index (BMI).
    # Formula: BMI = weight / (height^2)
    # - Get weight in kilograms and height in meters from the user.
    # - Compute the BMI using the above formula.
    # - Print the BMI.
    ```

6. **Simple Interest Calculation**
    ```python
    # Problem Description:
    # Write a program to calculate simple interest.
    # Formula: SI = (P * R * T) / 100
    # - Get the principal amount, rate of interest, and time period from the user.
    # - Compute the simple interest using the above formula.
    # - Print the simple interest.
    ```

7. **Circle Area and Circumference Calculation**
    ```python
    # Problem Description:
    # Write a program to calculate the area and circumference of a circle.
    # Formula: Area = π * r^2, Circumference = 2 * π * r
    # - Get the radius of the circle from the user.
    # - Compute the area and circumference using the above formulas.
    # - Print the area and circumference.
    ```
