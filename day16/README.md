# Python Day - 16. Homework
## Problem 1: Check Even or Odd
**Problem Description:**  
Write a program that checks if a user entered an even or odd number.

- Define a function named `is_even_or_odd()` with a single parameter `number`.
- Inside the function, check whether `number` is even or odd.
- If `number` is even, return "Even".
- Else, return "Odd".

## Problem 2: Add Two Numbers
**Problem Description:**  
Write a program to add two numbers.

- Define a function `add_two_numbers()` which takes two arguments `n1` and `n2`.
- Inside the function, find the sum of `n1` and `n2` and store it in a variable.
- Print the result inside the function.

## Problem 3: Find the Difference
**Problem Description:**  
Write a program to find the difference between two numbers.

- Define a function named `get_difference()` that accepts two parameters: `number1` and `number2`.
- Inside the function, subtract `number2` from `number1` and return the result.
- Get two integer inputs from the user and store them in `n1` and `n2`.
- Call the `get_difference()` function with arguments `n1` and `n2` respectively and store the return value in the `difference` variable.
- Print the `difference` variable.

## Problem 4: Calculate the Square of a Number
**Problem Description:**  
Write a program to calculate the square of a number.

- Define a function `calculate_square()` which takes one argument `number`.
- Inside the function, calculate the square of `number` and return the result.
- Get an integer input from the user and store it in `n`.
- Call the `calculate_square()` function with argument `n` and print the result.

## Problem 5: Check Positive, Negative, or Zero
**Problem Description:**  
Write a program to check if a number is positive, negative, or zero.

- Define a function `check_number()` which takes one argument `number`.
- Inside the function, check if `number` is positive, negative, or zero and print the result accordingly.
- Get an integer input from the user and call the `check_number()` function with the input.

## Problem 6: Multiply Three Numbers
**Problem Description:**  
Write a program to multiply three numbers.

- Define a function `multiply_three_numbers()` which takes three arguments `a`, `b`, and `c`.
- Inside the function, calculate the product of `a`, `b`, and `c` and print the result.
- Get three integer inputs from the user and call the `multiply_three_numbers()` function with the inputs.

## Problem 7: Calculate the Average
**Problem Description:**  
Write a program to calculate the average of three numbers.

- Define a function `calculate_average()` which takes three arguments `a`, `b`, and `c`.
- Inside the function, calculate the average of `a`, `b`, and `c` and return the result.
- Get three integer inputs from the user and store them in `n1`, `n2`, and `n3`.
- Call the `calculate_average()` function with arguments `n1`, `n2`, and `n3` and print the result.

## Problem 8: Check Divisibility
**Problem Description:**  
Write a program to check if a number is divisible by another number.

- Define a function `is_divisible()` which takes two arguments `num1` and `num2`.
- Inside the function, check if `num1` is divisible by `num2`. If true, return "Divisible". Otherwise, return "Not Divisible".
- Get two integer inputs from the user and call the `is_divisible()` function with the inputs.
- Print the result returned by the function.
